# IPCC Tool

Funded by the ANR, the Mapping Environmental DEbates on Adaptation (MEDEA)
Project proposes a research programme based on the innovative methodology
of controversy-mapping in order to understand and ultimately improve the way
we publicly discuss climate change adaptation.

MEDEA is based on an original disciplinary articulation resulting from
the collaboration of three partners:

* Sciences Po (médialab and IDDRI),
* the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et l'Environnement
* and the ENSADlab of the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs.

## Description of Database
Our database is populated with the names of each contributor to the 5
Assessment Reports (ARs) of the IPCC (the 5th AR is in the process of
being finalized). We define contributors as someone who fulfilled one
of four official roles in the writing of an AR, serving either as a:

* Contributing Lead Author (CLA),
* a Lead Author (LA),
* a Review Editor (RE),
* or a Contributing Author (CA).

In addition to the role, contributors are also associated with a number
of other attributes: institute of affiliation, country of affiliation,
Working Group participation and chapter contribution.

## Design Intentions
The combination and cross-referencing of these attributes--applied as
means of "filtering" and "sorting" the overall population--reveals
interesting trends, dynamics and sub-populations within the IPCC.

It is these relationships that we plan to make available to researchers
and the public for exploration through the design of an "interactive
visual and narrative platform".

The choices of design and functionalities for the platform are being made
with two primary user groups in mind:

1. a broader public for whom we are designing a structured narration
   and navigation of the data that will help orient journalists and
   interested citizens to pertinent information in the datascape
   (as well as give them the means to export visualizations for
   publication in print or on the web); and

2. a "search interface" that lets more advanced users (i.e. researchers)
   to directly query the database and extract underlying .csv or JSON
   files of the data for their own research purposes.

One of the epistemological goals of the medialab is to represent data
in a way that allows the "reader" of the data to navigate between
macro-aggregations and individual units of the data. This means designing
our platform so that users can zoom from the collective to the individual,
which in our case means navigating between ARs and individual contributors.

Thus, it is important that our central unit of accounting--the contributor--
form the core of our visualizations. In other words, representing each
separate individual unit as a point within the whole is a choice we would
like to emphasize as much as possible in the more aggregated configurations
of our data.
